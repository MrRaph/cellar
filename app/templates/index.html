      <p>I'm trying to learn about wine and I want to track what I like and
        don't like. This is a small app that I can use to track bottles in
        my cellar (aka my bookshelf).</p>

      <p>Why not use an existing service? I don't really care what anybody else
        thinks about wine, I just want to remember what I'm opening and where
        I got it.</p>

      <p>Starting small right now. The only interface is Django's admin because
        it does basically everything I need it to. I will probably put some sort
        of RESTful API or something up to interact with it from my phone but
        I'm not sure how that will work yet.</p>
