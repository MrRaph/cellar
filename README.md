# Cellar

I'm trying to learn about wine and I want to track what I like
and don't like. This is a small app that I can use to track bottles
in my cellar (aka my bookshelf).

Why not use an existing service? I don't really care what anybody else
thinks about wine, I just want to remember what I'm opening and where I
got it.

Starting small right now. The only interface is Django's admin because
it does basically everything I need it to. I will probably put some sort
of RESTful API or something up to interact with it from my phone but I'm
not sure how that will work yet.
